1. React portals are used to display elements/html at specific dom node in the dom tree.
2. createPortal takes in 2 args: jsx and the element selector where it is to be displayed.
3. It is useful when we need to display something independent of the main UI; example: alert.

4. Forwarding refs: refs can be passed down the component tree using special props;
5. func child(props, newRef) is used to access the ref.
6. Child is wrapped in forwardRef() hoc to access the newRef.

7. Error boundary is used to display fallback in case render step of react throws any error.
8. Error boundary is a class component with static method getDerivedStateFromError(err) to update state if error is found.
9. It also has a method componentDidCatch(err) which can be used to perform some operation when error is caught. ex: logging.

10. Keys are used by react to re-mount the component which is placed at same level in the react-dom.
11. Keys are used as unique identifiers to check for similarity between nodes placed at same level in react DOM tree.
12. Keys are also used to re-mount any existing component in DOM in case state changes.

13. Bubbling means event listener of child will be called first; and then parent.
14. Capturing: Capturing events from top to bottom. onClickCapture.

15. useLayoutEffect is similar to useEffect;
16. useEffect renders the html on first load; then runs the code within effect and then re-renders the html with updated data.
17. useLayoutEffect renders the html after the code within the effect is completed with updated data.
18. To prevent the UI lags on first render; we use useLayoutEffect.

19. useCallback can be used in place of useEffect and useRef to handle input in case of mount/un-mount.
20. useCallback takes in a function with the dom node which can be used for operations on ref.
21. This makes sure when ref is mounted/un-mounted we can check for element and do specific actions.

22. useImperativeHandle is a hook used to expose only relevant methods,properties to parent component accessing the ref of child component.
