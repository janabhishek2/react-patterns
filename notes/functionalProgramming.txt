Functional programming is a paradigm in which we treat functions as first class citizens.

USe cases:
1. Controlled components
2. Functional components
3. hocs
4. Recursive component.
5. Partial component.
6. Composition: output of one function served as ip to other; F(G(x)).

Composition: Similar to inheritance; using one base class and extending its properties to other classes. example: red button is composed of button class, small button is composed of button class.
