1. Controlled and uncontrolled components are 2 types of components in react.
2. Controlled components do not have their own state; they take data and handler/mutate functions from parent compnent.
3. Un-controlled components have their own state / data and handler functions; addtional functions can be passed from props and run with existing handler functions.
4. Controlled components are preferred.
