1. rtk query is the package made to integrate with redux to solve data-fetching problem.
2. Traditional approach uses: thunks/sagas and updates store.
3. 3 methods of api data fetching : fetch-before-render, fetch-during-render(rtk), fetch-after-render(redux/useEffect). 
4. redux: reducers, rtk: apiSlices.
5. In slices we setup all endpoints for a base url.
6. fetchBaseQuery is the fetch based wrapper to make api calls and get the data, error, states.
7. apiSlice exports 5 types of hooks: use{endpointName}Query, use{endPointName}LazyQuery.
8. useQuery hook is used to trigger api call as soon as it is called / during render. {data, isLoading, error} are received.
9. useLazyQuery is used to trigger api call on demand. [trigger, {data, isLoading, error}] are recevied from this hook.
